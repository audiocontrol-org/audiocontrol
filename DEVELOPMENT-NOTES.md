# Development Notes

Session journal for the audiocontrol project. Documents what we tried, what worked, what didn't, and — most importantly — how the user course-corrected the agent's approach.

Each correction is tagged by category for pattern analysis:
- **[COMPLEXITY]** — agent defaulted to complex solution, user wanted simpler
- **[UX]** — agent neglected user-facing feedback
- **[FABRICATION]** — agent stated something without evidence
- **[DOCUMENTATION]** — agent didn't document or read existing docs
- **[PROCESS]** — agent didn't follow established workflow

## 2026-04-09 / 2026-04-10: Library UX, Disk Browser, SDS Speed

### Feature: library-ux
### Worktree: audiocontrol-library-ux

### Goal
Improve the S3000XL editor's library UX: SCSI disk browser, drag-and-drop workflows, sample transfer speed.

### Accomplished
- SCSI disk browser with lazy metadata loading (~50KB vs 60MB+), collapsible volumes, context menus (`689da1fd`)
- Drag-and-drop: disk→library, disk→device, library→device with type filtering (`b98ccdf0`, `bfe221b6`, `6e0e1fae`)
- Three library sections (Samples, Programs, Akai Programs) with expandable programs (`112e457c`)
- NavLink query param preservation — real app bug fix (`0d2ef0bf`)
- SDS upload 9x faster via packet batching, 227ms→25ms per packet (`7088d535`)
- Bridge hardening: disconnect cancellation, exponential backoff, dynamic timeouts (`16a8b36c`, `2485d76e`)
- ASPACK discovery: 23.4 KB/s proprietary transfer, 10.6x faster than batched SDS (`e314fbc5`)
- S3000XL SysEx protocol reference doc (`e314fbc5`)
- SCSI travel log covering full reverse engineering journey (`0f308de8`, `b7d61f95`, `793164e6`)
- Progress indicators meeting project spec (bytes, elapsed, ETA) (`5bc223a3`)
- Sample rename after SDS upload (`510a2ace`)
- PR #186 merged to main

### Didn't Work
- Streaming port 6870 for SDS — doesn't relay device ACKs, dead end
- ASPACK multi-chunk writes (offset > 0) — empty reply, unsolved
- ASPACK sample creation — can only overwrite existing, not create new
- Pre-loading all volume files before save — hung UI for minutes
- Multiple iterations of defensive sleeps — all removed

### Course Corrections
- **[COMPLEXITY]** Added defensive sleeps (50ms, 100ms, 3s) throughout SDS path. User: "STOP TRYING TO ADD DELAYS." ACK is definitive. Removed all sleeps, implemented exponential backoff.
- **[COMPLEXITY]** Pre-loaded all 27 files in a volume before opening save dialog. User saw it hang. Fixed to load single file on demand.
- **[COMPLEXITY]** Built EditorDialogGroup package to share dialog rendering. Circular dependency. Abandoned after user asked "what are you doing?"
- **[UX]** Implemented disk browser with no loading indicators. User: "Garbage UX." Added scanning/reading states.
- **[UX]** No progress indicator on sample transfers. User had to ask repeatedly. Now required by project guidelines.
- **[UX]** Progress showed item count (3/10 samples) not bytes. User: "Showing the number of samples is useless since samples can range in size."
- **[UX]** Double-click to download — user: "double-clicking on an item almost never means download" and "Download as WAV is very counterintuitive in the context of a library."
- **[UX]** Hardcoded pixel widths for layout. User: "why are you using pixel values instead of the 12-column layout system?"
- **[FABRICATION]** Said S3000XL needed time to recover after failed transfer. User: "don't blame the device."
- **[FABRICATION]** Said MESA II used direct SCSI block writes to sampler memory. User: "No you can't write directly to the sampler's memory. You just made that up."
- **[FABRICATION]** Guessed sampler was stuck from previous test without checking logs. User: "why do you think that?"
- **[FABRICATION]** Fell back to hardcoded 44100 for zero sample rate. User: "why would you fall back to 44100 instead of interrogating the actual sample file?"
- **[DOCUMENTATION]** Didn't read the library-ux feature docs (PRD, workplan) at session start. Operated blind to 14 sub-feature documents and existing phase structure for the entire session.
- **[DOCUMENTATION]** User had to ask for protocol documentation, SCSI travel log, progress indicator guidelines — agent didn't create them proactively.
- **[PROCESS]** Didn't create feature branch/worktree for continuous improvement — started work on library-ux branch. User: "What do our project guidelines say about feature branches and worktrees?"
- **[PROCESS]** Set 5-minute timeout on a test expected to take seconds. User: "why did you set a 5 minute timeout?"
- **[PROCESS]** Used `sleep 30` to wait for test results instead of checking immediately. User: "why did you wait for 2 minutes to find out it was stuck?"
- **[PROCESS]** Tested ASPACK via control plane (HTTP sds/send) instead of data plane (raw SCSI CDBs). User: "the current sysex channel is meant for the control plane, not the data plane."

### Quantitative
- User messages: ~350+
- Commits: 37 (on library-ux branch)
- User corrections: ~20
- Tool calls: thousands (extended session spanning two days)
- Time sinks: SDS speed investigation (~4 hours), ASPACK exploration (~2 hours), drag-drop type filtering (~1 hour)

### Insights
1. Agent should read feature workplan at session start — would have known about existing phases
2. Every hardware claim should be tested, not reasoned about
3. Progress indicators should be implemented at the same time as the feature, not retrofitted
4. Documentation (protocol ref, travel log) was ultimately more valuable than some of the code
5. The user's instinct to "just try it" was right every time — the ASPACK discovery, the batch SDS test, the larger packet size test all happened because the user pushed past theorizing
