# mesa-ii-reverse-engineering

Reverse-engineer MESA II's sample data transfer protocol to fix S3000XL sample upload SLNGTH issue.

## Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Disassembly Infrastructure | Mostly Complete | m68k-elf-objdump + annotate_function.py pipeline (1241 funcs indexed). SendAudioBufferToSampler (443 instr) and BuildSampleHeaderFromMAH (224 instr) fully decoded with zero placeholders. Findings: 200-byte Akai header layout, BULK/SRAW/BOFF/UALL emission sequence, SLNGTH at bytes 26-29 in BYTES not words. |
| Phase 2: Protocol Validation | **Closed (decided #315; redirected per decision-record-2026-04-18.md)** | Dispatch chain fully decoded except SRAW; `ActivateThisSocket` and `UALL` confirmed application-side with zero wire output. The BULK upload is irreducibly stateful — not feasibly replicable from a stateless Node test. **Initial decision (#315):** pivot to Phase 3 via SDS optimization (Option 1). **Superseded same day** after Phase 3.1-3.3 data showed SDS at 2.91 KB/s ≈ 1.4x serial MIDI — not enough to justify the SCSI bridge complexity. **Current direction:** continue MESA II RE until we have a testable, data-backed hypothesis (next: SRAW decode, task #30). The MESA II reference in `mesa-ii-analysis/` is now an active working set, not just preserved documentation. |
| Phase 3: Bridge Implementation | **Option 2 committed; outbound CDB wire bytes MEASURED (Phase 3 question answered); runtime-patch mechanism OPEN** | Path A.9 (2026-04-21) established the OUTBOUND CDB format MEASURED: `0C 00 [len_hi] [len_mid] [len_lo] 80` (MIDI Send; 24-bit big-endian byte count; byte 5 = 0x80 for SRAW/flag=1). Bus emission via `SMSendData` at scsi-plug file 0x160c → JSR 0x1620 → SCSIDispatch `$A089`. **MAJOR CORRECTION:** session 11's "install edge dissolved — no runtime patching" was WRONG. Path A.9 showed the SRAW handler assembles a 7-arg stack frame at file 0x0f4a-0x0f5e that exactly matches SMSendData's calling convention, but JSR 0x106e in the binary-as-shipped is a `BRA.W` to the reply epilogue at 0x1160 — which contains no CDB construction. The only coherent explanation: 0x106e is a runtime-patchable slot (CANDIDATE, strong); displacement at 0x1070-0x1071 gets rewritten at load time to retarget SMSendData. Patcher identity is OPEN (task #35 = Path A.11). **REPLY-direction findings** (A.6/A.7/A.8) remain separately MEASURED: `CMESASocket::AcceptData` reply dispatch via `main → vtable[+0xA8] → ADAT handler`. Editor→plug SocketInfo transmission is OPEN (task #34 = Path A.10). Community writeup planned as terminal deliverable. |
