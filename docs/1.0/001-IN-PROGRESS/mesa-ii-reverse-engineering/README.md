# mesa-ii-reverse-engineering

Reverse-engineer MESA II's sample data transfer protocol to fix S3000XL sample upload SLNGTH issue.

## Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Disassembly Infrastructure | Mostly Complete | m68k-elf-objdump + annotate_function.py pipeline (1241 funcs indexed). SendAudioBufferToSampler (443 instr) and BuildSampleHeaderFromMAH (224 instr) fully decoded with zero placeholders. Findings: 200-byte Akai header layout, BULK/SRAW/BOFF/UALL emission sequence, SLNGTH at bytes 26-29 in BYTES not words. |
| Phase 2: Protocol Validation | **Closed (decided #315; redirected per decision-record-2026-04-18.md)** | Dispatch chain fully decoded except SRAW; `ActivateThisSocket` and `UALL` confirmed application-side with zero wire output. The BULK upload is irreducibly stateful — not feasibly replicable from a stateless Node test. **Initial decision (#315):** pivot to Phase 3 via SDS optimization (Option 1). **Superseded same day** after Phase 3.1-3.3 data showed SDS at 2.91 KB/s ≈ 1.4x serial MIDI — not enough to justify the SCSI bridge complexity. **Current direction:** continue MESA II RE until we have a testable, data-backed hypothesis (next: SRAW decode, task #30). The MESA II reference in `mesa-ii-analysis/` is now an active working set, not just preserved documentation. |
| Phase 3: Bridge Implementation | **REFRAMED 2026-04-22 per [#315 joint charter](https://github.com/audiocontrol-org/audiocontrol/issues/315): emulator-forward work is the active frontier** | **Sole goal:** make MESA run in emulation, satisfy the SCSI contract it expects, capture the real fast sample-transfer path. **Static-decode arc (Path A → A.18) is preserved for reference** but the prior "ship current bridge" framing is retracted as an explicit anti-goal per the charter. **MEASURED state going into emulator work:** patch hypothesis CLOSED in current static artifacts (A.11/A.15/A.16/A.17/A.18 + Codex parity); callback `$0x1E5A` = `SendCommandToEditor` (host/editor service tag-dispatcher, not patcher); hardware rejects `CDB[5]=0x80` for tested opcodes. **OPEN (the actual question per charter):** what host/service/SCSI contract must SheepShaver satisfy for MESA II to continue past INIT into its real fast sample-transfer path? **Active division of labor:** Claude owns emulator-forward execution; Codex owns contract recovery + falsification. **Investigation is NOT done.** Done = MESA runs in emulation far enough to exercise the fast transfer path AND the host/service/SCSI contract is reproducible. See [`project-state-2026-04-22-converged.md`](./project-state-2026-04-22-converged.md) for the static-decode reference; the "converged/ship" conclusion in that doc is retracted by this reframe. |
